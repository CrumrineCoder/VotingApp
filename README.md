# Voting App

Built for FreeCodecamp. Currently have the voting and viewing a poll done. These are the current things I'm working on in the project. 


1. CSS Styling 

1a. Have the submit poll button be disabled until the criteria are met. [Done]

1b. Don't show the vote or rescind buttons until everything is checked. [Done]

1c. Responsive Design

2. Close a poll from future voting option.

3. Delete a poll. [ Done ]

4. User removing all options in Edit poll. 

5. Check if a question is already made upon poll creation. 

Issues:
1. Replies with the same answer turn into one answer in the database. This should be done, but still require the user to make more than 1 reply when creating the poll, or if there's only 1 answer than make users able to write their own answers.
2. I suspect issues with  naming a reply something like null, user, question, or Open
