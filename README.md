# Voting App

Built for FreeCodecamp. Currently have the voting and viewing a poll done, and am now working on authentication. 

To Do Next:

1. Option to link a poll to a user account [DONE]

2. Search  functionality [DONE]

3. Other options during poll creation 

3a. Fixed vs open answers

3b. Multiple replies to a question from the user

3c. Allowing change of vote

3d. Allowing seeing the results before voting

3e. Captcha

4. Reworking routing depending on how I want the flow of the site to change

4a. Validating that the user has voted / the poll creator has allowed users to see the results before voting

4b. Return to questions screen on the Results page

4c. User can edit their polls after creating them if they link them to their account

5. Fluff up Results page with a bar graph and such 

6. CSS touch up

Issues:
1. Replies with the same answer turn into one answer in the database
2. I suspect issues with  naming a reply something like null, user, question, or Open
