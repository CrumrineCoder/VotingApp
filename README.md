# Voting App

Built for FreeCodecamp. Currently have the voting and viewing a poll done. These are the current things I'm working on in the project. 

1. Close and open a poll from voting.

Issues:
1. Replies with the same answer turn into one answer in the database. This should be done, but still require the user to make more than 1 reply when creating the poll, or if there's only 1 answer than make users able to write their own answers.
2. I suspect issues with  naming a reply something like null, user, question, or Open
3. Apostrophe in a question means the question shown in the  Edit Poll section is wrong
